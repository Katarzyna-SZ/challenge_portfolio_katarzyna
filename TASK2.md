### Subtask 3 - Why do we write test cases?
<p align=justify> Overall, we write test cases to document various ways of handling application functionality. We can determine the coverege of test cases and, in a measurable way, define if we understod the functionalities described in User Stories. Test Cases serve as a valuable source of knowledge about the software, what is especially important with new team members/testers coming to a project. Last not least, a formally defined test cases allow for running the same tests multiple times in subsequent software versions and constitute the basis for regression testing. </p>
